PropControl uses a separate workflow for each prop, i.e. all the actions related to a particular device are contained in a separate tab in the node-red editor. There are also separate tabs for global configuration, and subsystems like lighting and audio.

The layout of most workflows follows a similar pattern:
* Messages (e.g. status updates) received from the device are shown on the left hand side of the workflow. PropControl is designed to work with different message encoding and connections. So, for example, a message might be encoded as JSON and delivered via an MQTT server. Or it could be plain text delivered via a USB serial connection.
* Various logic and transformations are applied to the incoming message through a series of nodes.
* The state of the puzzle is represented by one or more dashboard nodes.
* The dashboard also presents buttons or other controls that are used to send messages *to* the device.
* These messages are passed to the output node contained on the right-hand side of the workflow.
