The Game Control workflow contains logic 


## Global Variables
The following global variables are made available for use in any workflow 
* **lastTickTime** is the timestamp at which the last tick event occurred.
* **timeRemaining** is the time remaining in the current game (expressed in millisseconds)
* **gameState** is the current state of the game - "playing" or "stopped".

## Events
The following events are triggered by the game control workflow, and may be used to launch functions in any other workflows by using a **Link In** node linked to the coresponding event.
* **On Initialisation** is fired every time the server is started. It is typically used for initial configuration.
* **On Game Start** is fired when the game starts (i.e. when the play button is pressed on the dashboard and the game timer starts counting down)
* **On Game Stop** is fired when the game is stopped (i.e. when the stop button is pressed on the dashboard and the game timer stops counting down)
* **On Tick** is fired once every second. It is used to trigger any events that need to be continuously manually refreshed
* **On Browser Refresh** is fired whenever a client connects to or refreshes their connection to the browser-based dashboard
